# Dolphindes üê¨

Dolphindes (very loosely, Dual Optimization Limits for PHotonic/PHysical INverse DESign) is a Python package for calculating limits on the performance of photonic devices using dual optimization methods. It can calculate structure-agnostic performance bounds for a wide range of photonic problems. The package works by relaxing the photonic inverse design problem into a field optimization problem, which can then be further relaxed into a convex problem using Lagrange duality. 

## üì¶ Installation 

### 1. Install System Dependencies

Make sure you have `libsuitesparse-dev` installed. This is required by scikit-sparse 

For Debian/Ubuntu systems:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libsuitesparse-dev
``` 

### 2. Setup and activate the provided conda environment dolphindes.yml

## üîß Running Tests

To run the dolphindes tests, simply run 

```bash
pytest
```

Optionally, provide the -s flag to print the output of the tests. You will need to have `pytest` and `pytest-dependency` installed in your environment. 

## üìö Documentation and Tutorials

We are currently working on more comprehensive documentation. For now, please refer to the Jupyter Notebooks in the examples/ directory for detailed demonstrations on using dolphindes to compute bounds for photonic inverse design problems and extract design templates.
